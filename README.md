# weather-app
A cool web app I created while bored in quarantine. It utilizes the [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and [open weather map API](https://openweathermap.org/), along with [chart.js](chartjs.org/) - to display the graphs. 

It displays primary information regarding the weather outside of the designated area - such as the cloudiness, temperature (min and max),  humidity, etc. Furthermore, I also chose to construct a graph using the [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and [chart.js](chartjs.org/). It displays the average weather for each day within the past week (you can specify the amount of days).
