# weather-app
A cool web app I created while bored in quarantine. It uses the weather API and open weather map API, along with chart.js - to display the graphs. 

It displays primary information regarding the weather outside of the designated area - such as the cloudiness, temperature (min and max),  humidity, etc. In addition to the information, I chose to construct a graph using the weather API and chart.js. It displays the average weather for each day in the past that can go as far as a week.
